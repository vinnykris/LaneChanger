{"name":"Lane Changer","tagline":"A two-player game to see who can weave through the most traffic.","body":"# LaneChanger\r\nLane Changer is an original game I worked on as an individual project in my AP Computer Science class. \r\nThis game implements KeyListeners to read a user's keystrokes and have the program react accordingly.\r\nThe idea of the game is for the player to avoid hitting all of the traffic by \"switching lanes\", which is done\r\nby using the right or left arrow keys. The game is made for two players, the first player attempts to reach\r\nas many levels as he/she can and the second player attempts to best that. Game logic is also implemented; if both \r\nplayers reach the same level, they have the option to restart the game to break the tie.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
