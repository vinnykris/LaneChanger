<p>Lane Changer is an original game I worked on as an individual project in my AP Computer Science class. 
This game implements KeyListeners to read a user's keystrokes and have the program react accordingly.
The idea of the game is for the player to avoid hitting all of the traffic by "switching lanes", which is done
by using the right or left arrow keys. The game is made for two players, the first player attempts to reach
as many levels as he/she can and the second player attempts to best that. Game logic is also implemented; if both 
players reach the same level, they have the option to restart the game to break the tie.</p>
